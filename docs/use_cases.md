# AICP Use Cases

## 1. Real-Time Robotic Automation in Manufacturing
- **Scenario**: A factory uses robots for quality inspection of products.
- **AICP Usage**: Robots generate image tensors that are sent in real-time for AI inference. The packets are prioritized to ensure low-latency communication. The edge router ensures the data reaches the AI model for quick decision-making.

## 2. Predictive Maintenance in Industrial Equipment
- **Scenario**: Sensors on industrial machinery collect data for predictive maintenance analysis.
- **AICP Usage**: Data is transmitted with low priority for periodic analysis. The transport layer uses adaptive reliability to ensure timely data delivery without network congestion.

## 3. Real-Time Analytics in Smart Cities
- **Scenario**: Cameras in a smart city transmit video feeds to a central server for analysis.
- **AICP Usage**: Video frames are serialized as tensors and transmitted in low-latency packets for real-time processing. TSN support ensures deterministic delivery during peak loads.
